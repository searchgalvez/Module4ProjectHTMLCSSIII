# HTML & CSS III - Module Project

## Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your computer using git: `git clone <this repository's clone link>`
2. Open the project folder in VSCode, and open `index.html` in the Chrome browser:
    - VSCode is where you will make changes to the code.
    - Chrome is where you will check if your code is working correctly.
3. In Chrome, open DevTools, Elements tab:
    - Most elements on the page are generated with JavaScript and don't appear in the HTML source code.
    - This means that the Elements tab is the only place where you can inspect these elements.
4. Return to `index.html` and start working on your tasks.
5. When you want to check if your code is correct, save changes in VSCode, go to Chrome and refresh the page.
6. Find screenshots of the end result of this challenge inside the `design` folder.
